  It appears as though the awards day and the leaderboard day are off by one. The leaderboard for day 2 is actually the leaderboard for day 3, and the leaderboard for day 3 is actually the leaderboard for day 2. The awards for day 2 are actually the awards for day 3, and the awards for day 3 are actually the awards for day 2.
