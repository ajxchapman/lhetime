### Positional Standings

* Where possible, positional standings should be consistent with the final leaderboard. Where these differ from the awarded positions, the leaderboard should take precedence.
* Where multi-day / program events are recorded, positional standings should be recorded per day / program where possible. Where this is not possible, the positional standings should be recorded against the main event.
